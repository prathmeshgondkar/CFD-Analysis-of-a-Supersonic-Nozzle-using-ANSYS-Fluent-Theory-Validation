# 🚀 CFD Analysis of Converging-Diverging Nozzle (Gas Dynamics Project)

**Course:** MECH 6111 – Gas Dynamics  
**Term:** Fall 2024  
**Instructor:** Dr. Pierre Q. Gauthier  
**University:** Concordia University

## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates high-speed compressible flow through a converging-diverging (C-D) nozzle using CFD simulations and theoretical 1d analysis. It explores how back pressure variations influence:

- Choked flow at the throat  
- Supersonic flow through a divergent section  
- Normal shocks within the nozzle  
- Oblique shocks outside the nozzle  
- Expansion waves beyond the exit  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- ANSYS Fluent & CFX  
- ANSYS DesignModeler (Geometry)  
- ANSYS Meshing  
- 1d Theory: Isentropic flow tables and shock relations  
- Excel + Word for reporting

## 📈 Methodology Summary
1. Geometry and mesh design based on target Mach numbers  
2. Density-based solver setup with inviscid, planar assumptions  
3. Parametric study on back pressure  
4. Validation against 1d theory  

## 📊 Key Results (CFD vs Analytical)

| Flow Case        | Analytical Mach | CFD Mach | Error % |
|------------------|------------------|----------|---------|
| Choked Exit      | 0.226            | 0.215    | 4.9%    |
| Supersonic Exit  | 2.5              | 2.5217   | 0.9%    |
| Oblique Shock    | 2.39             | 2.38     | 0.4%    |
| Expansion Flow   | 2.94             | 2.946    | 0.2%    |
